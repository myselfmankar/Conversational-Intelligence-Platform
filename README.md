## Key Features

-   üìà **Dynamic & Interactive Dashboards:** All visualizations are built with Plotly, allowing for zooming, panning, and hovering to explore the data in detail.
-   üòä **Advanced Sentiment Analysis:** Leverages a fine-tuned RoBERTa model (`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`) to classify messages as Positive, Neutral, or Negative with high accuracy on informal text.
-   üß† **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Automatically extracts and quantifies key entities like **People (PER)**, **Organizations (ORG)**, and **Locations (LOC)** from your chats using a powerful BERT-based model.
-   üåê **Social Network Analysis:** Generates and visualizes a directed graph of user interactions to identify the most central and influential people in the group.
-   üíæ **Data Exploration & Download:** A dedicated tab allows users to view the raw parsed data and the fully enriched data with all NLP insights, and download them as CSV files.
-   üîç **Robust Filtering:** The entire dashboard can be dynamically filtered by author, keyword, and sentiment, allowing for granular analysis of specific conversations or user behaviors.
-   üöÄ **Optimized Performance:** Implements batch processing for NLP tasks and caching (`@st.cache_data`) to ensure fast and efficient analysis, even on large chat files.

## How It Works

1.  **Upload:** The user uploads a WhatsApp chat `.txt` export file.
2.  **Parse:** A custom parser processes the file, handling multi-line messages and system notifications, and converts it into a structured Pandas DataFrame.
3.  **Enrich with NLP:** The application performs a multi-stage NLP pipeline on the text data:
    -   Long messages are summarized.
    -   Sentiment is classified for each message.
    -   Named Entities are extracted.
4.  **Visualize:** The enriched DataFrame is passed to the dashboard, where Plotly and NetworkX are used to generate a suite of interactive charts and graphs.
5.  **Interact:** The user can filter the entire dataset to drill down into specific insights.

## Setup and Local Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: The first time you run this, it may download large model files from Hugging Face.)*

4.  **Run the Streamlit App**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will open in your web browser.

## Future Work

This project has a solid foundation, but there's always room for more! Potential future enhancements include:
-   [ ] **Containerization:** Package the application with Docker for improved portability and easier deployment.
-   [ ] **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the containerized app on a cloud service like AWS App Runner or GCP Cloud Run for greater control and scalability.
-   [ ] **Toxicity Detection:** Add another NLP model to identify and flag toxic or harmful messages.
-   [ ] **Topic Modeling:** Implement an unsupervised model like BERTopic to automatically discover the main conversation themes without pre-defined keywords.
